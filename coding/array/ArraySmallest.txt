1. String Manipulations
Key Concepts: String traversal, substring search, pattern matching, character frequency, string reversal, palindrome checks.
Practice Problems:

Check if two strings are anagrams.
Longest common prefix.
Longest palindromic substring.
Implement a basic string compression algorithm (e.g., "aaabb" â†’ "a3b2").
Find the first non-repeating character in a string.
Count the occurrences of a substring in a string.


2. Array Manipulation
Key Concepts: Array traversal, two-pointer technique, sliding window, prefix sums, matrix manipulations.
Practice Problems:

3. Sorting
Key Concepts: Bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort, quicksort, heapsort, counting sort.
Practice Problems:

5. Number Theory
Key Concepts: Prime numbers, greatest common divisor (GCD), least common multiple (LCM), modular arithmetic.
Practice Problems:
